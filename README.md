# ðŸŽ§ MoodTunes

**MoodTunes** is a playful, lightweight Spotify-inspired microsite that helps users discover real Spotify playlists based on their current mood â€” and how intensely theyâ€™re feeling it.

This was built as part of the **Bespoke x Spotify Assessment** to showcase UI/UX thinking, animation, and single-page engagement without the use of backend services or Spotify APIs.

## ðŸ§  Project Rationale

The idea was to simulate a branded Spotify experience that feels personal, engaging, and mobile-first.  
I chose an emoji-driven interface to simplify mood selection, layered in a follow-up **intensity slider**, and added real Spotify playlist links to complete the flow.

Animations, smooth transitions, and share functionality (Twitter, WhatsApp, and Copy Link) round out the experience.
